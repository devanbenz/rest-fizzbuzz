# REST FizzBuzz
**FizzBuzz** is a popular method of testing a beginner programmer's ability. The objective of FizzBuzz is to count up from 1 to *n*. If the current integer is divisible by 3 you replace that integer with **Fizz**. If the current integer is divisible by 5 it gets replaced by **Buzz**, finally if its divisible by both 3 and 5 then it is replaced by **FizzBuzz**. 

Easy enough! But! What if I created a REST API that did FizzBuzz instead? Well, thats the goal of this repository. I will go *completely* overboard and build a **FizzBuzz REST API** powered by NestJs!
